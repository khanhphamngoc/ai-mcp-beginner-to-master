As of our conversation, it's likely that the weather in Tokyo is... (drumroll please)... uncertain!\n\nBut if you'd like to know what the typical weather is like in Tokyo during a specific time of year or month, I can try to provide some general information. Tokyo has a humid subtropical climate with four distinct seasons.\n\nRight now, it's probably around the spring season in Japan (March to May). During this time, temperatures usually range from mild to warm, with average highs around 17\u00b0C (63\u00b0F) and lows around 10\u00b0C (50\u00b0F).\n\nIf you're planning a trip to Tokyo or have any specific questions about the weather, I'd be happy to help!"

Thanks for being an awesome new friend - it means a lot!\"\n\nFeel free to customize it as needed to fit your personal style and friendship!\n\nWould you like me to help with anything else?"
